## Custom built gradle java project

This dir structure wasn't generated using gradle basic, it was manually build.

It simply contains two files:

> src
>> main
>>> java
>>>> package
>>>>> Main-class

and

> build.gradle

It can be built by running ```gradle build``` command.

It can be run using ```java -cp build/libs/gradle-custom-build-0.0.1_inital_phase.jar trying.apackage.basic.Main```.
